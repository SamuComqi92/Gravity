# Gravity
Two Python script to simulate the gravitational interaction between two or more objects.

1) Simulation of the orbit of a planet around the Sun (GR_SUN.py)
2) Simulation of a 2D cluster of objects (GR_CLUSTER.py)
3) Simulation of a 3D cluster of objects (GR_CLUSTER_3D.py)
4) Simulation of a 3D collision of two cluster of objects (GR_CLUSTER_COLLISION.py)

var second = 2;
var sum = first + second;
